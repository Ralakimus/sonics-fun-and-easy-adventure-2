# Sonic's Fun And Easy Adventure 2

The cancelled sequel to Sonic's Fun And Easy Adventure, which would've been a maze that changes its layout and wraps around at times to really make for a super fun adventure for the whole family.

In its current state, only the level layout was modified and is incomplete. The code to handle changing the layout in realtime and wrapping is also complete and utter spaghetti. Tread lightly.
